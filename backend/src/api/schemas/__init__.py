"""
German Class Tool - API Schemas Module

This module provides data validation and serialization schemas for the API layer,
following clean architecture principles as outlined in the documentation.

Schema Components:
- Data validation schemas for request/response validation
- Serialization schemas for API responses
- Type definitions for API data structures

Note: This module is currently empty but provides the structure for future
schema implementations using libraries like Pydantic or Marshmallow.

For detailed architecture information, see: docs/backend_structure.md
